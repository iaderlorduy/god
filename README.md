The game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is very simple. Each player picks one of the three objects and these rules are applied to see who has won that round: Paper wraps (beats) Rock Scissors cut (beat) Paper Rock blunts (beats) Scissors The challenge of the game is to guess what your opponent will choose and pick the appropriate object to beat them.
